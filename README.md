Backbone-Infinite-List
===============================

A backbone view with infinite scroll ( that really works on mobile )
Works with either scrolling the window or a div althought it's nicer on a div.


NOTICE: Code is in working Draft.
Scroll on the window is not implemented (You can only use overflow scroll / webkit-overflow scroll )

Works smoothly on Android 4+;
iOs 5+;
